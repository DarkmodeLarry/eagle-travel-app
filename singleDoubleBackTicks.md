what are the differences between single, double, and backtick quotes.
In JavaScript, you can use three types of quotes to define string values: single quotes ('), double quotes ("), and backticks (`). Here are the main differences between these three types of quotes:

Single quotes and double quotes are interchangeable in most cases. The main difference is that you can use the other type of quote within a string without having to escape it. For example:
Copy code
let str1 = 'Hello, "world"!';
let str2 = "Hello, 'world'!";
Backticks (also known as template literals) allow you to define a string that spans multiple lines and can include expressions that are interpolated into the string. For example:
Copy code
let str = `Hello,
world!`;

let name = 'Bob';
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; // "Hello, Bob!"
Backticks also allow you to define a string that includes a literal backtick character by using the \ escape sequence. For example:
Copy code
let str = `Hello, \`world\`!`;
In general, you can choose which type of quotes to use based on your personal preference and the conventions of your project. However, it's a good idea to be consistent and use the same type of quotes throughout your code.
